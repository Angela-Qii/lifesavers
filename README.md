Statement Question:
How can women with psoriasis accurately capture and track key information about their diagnosis, including symptoms, triggers, and treatment schedules, to enhance patient advocacy and optimize health outcomes?
What is the problem?
Women with psoriasis often struggle with self-management and effective communication of their condition to healthcare providers due to inconsistent tracking and documentation. This can hinder their ability to advocate for proper care and achieve optimal treatment outcomes.

Why is this problem important to solve?

Psoriasis is not just a skin condition but a systemic disease associated with severe comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and depression.
Addressing these barriers will empower women to take charge of their health, leading to improved treatment adherence, better health outcomes, and enhanced quality of life.
Solutions that improve communication between patients and providers can drive more personalized and effective care plans, improving patient satisfaction and reducing healthcare costs.

Needs:
Most health tracking apps are tailored to only tracking 1 condition or general health
Existing tracking apps don't include certain features/aesthetics that some people might prefer
The impact of inaction is that people might choose a less efficient app for their condition or simply decide not to track their health
Educate people about differences in psoriasis symptoms/information depending on gender
Concerns:
Limited user base? people who use tracking apps already have a pre-existing health condition.
